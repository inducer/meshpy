MeshPy offers quality triangular and tetrahedral mesh generation for Python.
Meshes of this type are mainly used in finite-element simulation codes, but
also have many other applications ranging from computer graphics to robotics.

In order to generate 2D and 3D meshes, MeshPy provides Python interfaces to
two well-regarded mesh generators: `Triangle
<http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html>`__ by J. Shewchuk and `TetGen
<http://tetgen.berlios.de/>`__ by Hang Si. The two are included in the
package in slightly modified versions.

For an interface to `gmsh <http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/>`__, by Christophe Geuzaine
and Jean-Francois Remacle, see `gmsh_interop <https://github.com/inducer/gmsh_interop>`__.
